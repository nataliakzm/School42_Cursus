## 🗣️ About

> _The aim of this project is to make students learn about **static variables**_

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/nataliakzm/School42_Cursus/blob/main/Get_Next_Line/en.subject%20(1).pdf).

	🚀 TLDR: Because reading a line from a fd is way too tedious, this project is about creating your own function that 
	returns a line read from one file descriptor. The function get_next_line() returns NULL, if there is nothing else 
	to read or if an error occurred. It should work as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard output.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Using it in your code**

To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag:

```shell
get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
```

If you're on Linux, you may as well need the following flags:

```shell
-D ARG_MAX="sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)" -D OPEN_MAX=1024
```
