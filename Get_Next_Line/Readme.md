## 🗣️ About

> _The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor._

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/appinha/42cursus/tree/master/_PDFs).

	🚀 TLDR: this project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.

## 📑 Index

`@root`

* [**📁 get_next_line:**](get_next_line/) source code developed for the project.
* [**📁 testing:**](testing/) my own testing program.

`@/get_next_line/`

_Note: Files suffixed with *_bonus* are exact copies of corresponding files._

**Functions in `get_next_line.c`**

* `ft_free_null`	- free and null a pointer.
* `ft_cpy_exc_buff`	- copy read excess (string after \n) to static variable (buffer).
* `ft_buff2line`	- copy read line from buffer.
* `get_next_line`	- main function.

**Functions in `get_next_line_utils.c`**

* `ft_strlen`		- find length of string.
* `ft_strdup`		- save a copy of a string (with malloc).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Using it in your code**

To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag:

```shell
get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
```

If you're on Linux, you may as well need the following flags:

```shell
-D ARG_MAX="sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)" -D OPEN_MAX=1024
```

## 📋 Testing

**1. Configuring**

First, open the [`Makefile`](testing/Makefile) inside `/testing/` and configure the path to the `get_next_line` folder:

```Makefile
GNL_FOLDER	= ../get_next_line
```

**2. Running:**

For basic testing, run:

```shell
make
```

For other tests, check all available rules in the [`Makefile`](testing/Makefile).

```shell
make buf5000
```
