## üó£Ô∏è About

> _The aim of this project is to make students learn about **static variables**_

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/nataliakzm/School42_Cursus/blob/main/Get_Next_Line/en.subject%20(1).pdf).

	üöÄ TLDR: Because reading a line from a fd is way too tedious, this project is about creating your own function that 
	returns a line read from one file descriptor. The function get_next_line() returns NULL, if there is nothing else 
	to read or if an error occurred. It should work as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard output.

### Functions in `get_next_line.c`

* `ft_free_null`	- free and null a pointer.
* `ft_cpy_exc_buff`	- copy read excess (string after \n) to static variable (buffer).
* `ft_buff2line`	- copy read line from buffer.
* `get_next_line`	- main function.

### Functions in `get_next_line_utils.c`

* `ft_strlen`		- find length of string.
* `ft_strdup`		- save a copy of a string (with malloc).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Using it in your code**

To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag:

```shell
get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
```

If you're on Linux, you may as well need the following flags:

```shell
-D ARG_MAX="sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)" -D OPEN_MAX=1024
```
